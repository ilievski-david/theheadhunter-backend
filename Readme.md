# Backend task

## Project info

The server is coded with golang. I used gin for the http server and gorm as a database orm. The database I used is a managed postgres database hosted on digital ocean. The server is dockeriezed and hosted on a vps as a docker image. I also implemented ssl for https calls. The api is rest compliant. The address for the server is https://theheadhunter-server.davidilievski.dev:8080.

## Tasks
✅ DONE ❌ NOT DONE 👷 WIP
1. ✅ Go through the frontend task and implement its server side REST api.
2. ✅ Use the Go programming language.
3. ✅ Use whatever serialization (or in memory) solution you like to store data.
4. ✅ There is no need for any authentication related functionality.
5. ✅ Implement validation as described in the frontend task.
6. ✅ Please send Github linkith your solution. (We accept half-finished solutions as well.)

### For extra points
1. ✅ Use a postgres database to save data.
2. 👷 Write tests.
3. ✅ Dockerize your app.
4. ✅ Install your server somewhere (and share its URL with us).
5. ✅ Create a README in your repo and add notes bout installation, implementation details or any important info about your solution.
